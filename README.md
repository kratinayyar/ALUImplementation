This is the second project for my Intro to Computer Engineering 
class. This class was taken in Fall 2012. All projects in this
course required the use of the DE0 Nano Board.

The objectives of this project were to design, simulate, and
implement an ALU. The ALU for this project ran all of the 
following operations: add, sub, inc, dec, neg, and, or, not, 
xor, lsl, and lsr. The ALU took two 8-bit operands as inputs
and performed the operation on those sperands specified by a
4-bit opcode. The ALU generated the 8-bit result of the opera-
tion as well as the four status bits. The four status bits were
based on each of the individual statuses of overflow, zero, 
carry out, and negative. 

The ALU I implemented is part of a larger system that will 
supply it with implements and displays outputs. These were 
written by the professor.

This project was ran using Quartus and the DE0 Nano board.
If you would like to run my program and have all the materials 
needed please email me and I can provide you with the remainder
of the required files.
